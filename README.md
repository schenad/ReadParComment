# ReadParComment
Outputing the comments from all the STM .par files under the same folder. Matlab is required. 
## .par
*.par are the parameter files generated by SCALA, which is the program to run the VT-STM measuremnts and to do the analysis. *.par file needs to be pair with *.tf0 or *.tb0 (forward or backward) to open a forward or backward scan. The scan conditions are stored only in *.par files, and we also store the experiment conditions in the comment section.
## Version History
### ReadPar.m
An upgrade from ReadParComment.m, read also the scan conditions (Gap Voltage and Feedback Set) and output to the second column. 
### ReadParComment.m
ReadParComment.m reads the comment section, date and time when the scan was taken from each *.par file in the same folder (can be changed to desired directory) and outputs all the information into an excel file.
